# Time for a Change

This year we're going all veggie, every day. It's time to take climate impact
seriously, plus cows are cute. And supposedly we're not that anatomically 
different fomr pigs, which is unsettling at best. Bring on the veg, I say. Today
is the first day of the rest of our chives.

Sorry not sorry
